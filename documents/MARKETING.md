## Meta Business Suite:
Meta Business Suite is essentially the upgraded version of Facebook Page Manager. Business Suite was launched in 2020 and unlike Facebook Page Manager can be used both on desktop and mobile. 
This is an all-in-one solution for the marketing team to manage Facebook and Instagram accounts from one centarlised place.<br>
It allows page administrators:
* Create posts for both Facebook and Instagram
* Respond to commnets and messages from both networks
* View any page notifications
* View page insights 
* Schedule posts for both networks using their built in planner.

&nbsp;


### Planner: 
For the purpose of this project I created a Meta Business Suite account and set up a Facebook and Instagram account for Alices Wonderland. Using the built in post planner I was able to schedule posts to go up on both Facebook and Instagram over the course of the project.

### Pixel:
The Meta pixel is a piece of code on your website that can help you better understand the effectiveness of your advertising and the actions that people take on your site, such as visiting a page or adding an item to their basket. You'll also be able to see when customers took an action after seeing your ad on Facebook and Instagram, which can help you with retargeting.
It is a snippet of javascript that you paste into the header section of your website, just above the closing head tag.
