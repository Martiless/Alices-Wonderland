## SEO:
Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is critical to any website. It is what makes your website more visible to search engines, which results in more traffic to your website and a better chance you have of selling more products.   
SEO works using a mixture of Keyword Analysis, Backlink Building and Content Creation.       
### Keyword Analysis:
Keywords can be single words or phrases that searchers use regularly to find what they are looking for. It is best to do your research on keywords that would suit your business, What are you selling? What might the customer be looking for? Who might be searching, someone buying from themselves or a gift?   
Potently customers will use certain words or phrases when searching for products online, this is why keywords are so important to SEO. Once the research has been done, you must now strategically place these keywords throughout your content making sure you are not just "Keyword Stuffing"    
Keyword Stuffing, also known as webspam, is a method of SEO that involves overloading your [meta tags](#meta-tags), [backlinks](#backlink-building) and [content](#content-creation) to gain an unfair rank in search engines. However, according to Google, this practice can be more harmful than useful to your ranking, as Google can remove the site from its index so it doesn't appear in search results at all.   

### Backlink Building:
Backlinks are elements on a site that links back to other, typically high-quality, highly creditable sites. In the instance of this site, we backlinked to Facebook and Instagram. As well as the [Online Sitemap Generator](www.xml-sitemaps.com) that was used to create the sitemap for Alices Wonderland. 
It is very important to be strategic when backlink building as you do not want your site to get lost amongst the sea of other sources.   

### Content Creation:
Your content is a huge part of your SEO. This is what shows potential customers what it is you do and allows you to communicate with them. The balance between being the data-driven and having a "human" aspect to your business is created with your content. 
Content is anything that visitors to your site can see or hear, for example, images, videos, blogs post, reviews, newsletters, etc. It advances your SEO by engaging with your customer base, therefore driving much-needed traffic.  
It is the content on your site that tells the visitors to the site who you are and what you can offer them.   

### Meta Tags:
The meta tags are bits of code that give the search engines relevant information about a site. They are added to the ***head*** section of your HTML page, in the case of the [base.html](/templates/base.html) file and look like this

## Meta Business Suite:
Meta Business Suite is essentially the upgraded version of Facebook Page Manager. Business Suite was launched in 2020 and unlike Page Manager, can be used both on desktop and mobile. 
This is an all-in-one solution for the marketing team to manage Facebook and Instagram accounts from one centralised place.<br>
It allows page administrators:
* Create posts for both Facebook and Instagram
* Respond to comments and messages from both networks
* View any page notifications
* View page insights 
* Schedule posts for both networks using their built-in planner.

&nbsp;


### Planner: 
For this project, I created a Meta Business Suite account and set up a Facebook and Instagram account for Alices Wonderland. Using the built-in post planner I was able to schedule posts to go up on both Facebook and Instagram throughout the project.

### Pixel:
The Meta pixel is a piece of code on your website that can help you better understand the effectiveness of your advertising and the actions that people take on your site, such as visiting a page or adding an item to their basket. You'll also be able to see when customers took an action after seeing your ad on Facebook and Instagram, which can help you with retargeting.
It is a snippet of javascript that you paste into the header section of your website, just above the closing head tag.
For information on how to set up and install Pixel, check out [Metas Business Help Centre](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755?id=1205376682832142)

## Email Marketing:
For this purpose of this project, a [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/en-gb/) account was set up. Mailchimp is a quick and easy way for businesses to send news and updates to anyone who has signed up for their newsletter. 
It has an easy drag-and-drop layout, which means that the marketing team do not need any level of programming to create eye-catching emails. 
All the subscribers can be uploaded from the database created via the signup form on the website. Alternatively, Mailchimp can be integrated with the site allowing you to send emails straight from the site.
For more information on integrating Mailchimp with your site click [here](https://mailchimp.com/en-gb/help/about-integrations/)

Below is a sample Mailchimp email built using MailChimp's preset templates.

## TikTok:
TikTok is a short-form video share platform and is becoming one of the most popular social networks in the world today. As of October 2022, TikTok has over 1 billion active users worldwide and has been downloaded over 2.6 billion times.
Even though TikTok would have quite a large younger audience, with a whopping 62% of their users being under 30. However, the percentage of 30-year+ users is steadily increasing. Therefore, in the coming months Alices Wonderland will be launching a TikTok account.

***

## Hootsuite:
Another tool that could be useful for the marketing team is [Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/en-gb). Hootsuite is a social media planning tool that allows you to schedule content across multiple platforms. Unlike Meta Business Suite, Hootsuite allows users to include social networks such as Twitter, Linkedin, Youtube and Pinterest. However, they no longer offer a free version of their service with a minimum rate costing €49 a month. Hootsuite is a great tool if you are a large company with several different media platforms, however, for small businesses [Meta Business Suite](#meta-business-suite) would do a perfect job. 

*** 

## Twitter: 
Twitter was intentionally left off as a social media platform for this business. Although Twitter is still a highly popular social network, it was felt that for this particular business focus was to be put on Facebook and Instagram as that is where the target audience is most likely to spend their time.
