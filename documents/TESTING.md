## Manual Test:

### General:
Using Google devtools I tested each page of the site to insure that it was responsive to different devices.
One the website was deployed it was also tested on different browsers, i.e Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Testing was also performed on differnt operating systems, in particular Andriod and iOS.

### Navbar and Footer Links: 
On each page there is a navigation bar and a footer that needs to be tested, the following checks were made: 
* By clicking on the resturant logo the home page was reloaded
* By clicking on each of the tabs in the navbar you are redirected to the right page
* All social media links worked correctly, opening the social network on a new tab

## Automated Test:
Automated testing was done on the views.py file. This file was pick as it allowed testing of the views but also the CRUD functionality of the site.   
To view the automated testing please go to [testing_views.py]()
For testing the view I created 10 automated tests. One to test each view and then to test the CRUD functionality. Each test passed when I ran the command in the terminal   
![Testing]()
