## Python Validation steps:

Due to [pep8online](http://ww7.pep8online.com/) being down Code Institue has recommended another form of Python valiation. The steps are as follows:   
1. Run the command ***pip3 install pycodestyle***
1. In your workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the search bar.
1. Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results.
1. Select pycodestyle from the list, if you get a notification asking if you want to use pycodestyle click yes.   
1. Any PEP8 errors in your code will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.
