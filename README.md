# Alices Wonderland: 

This website is designed for a fictional shop based in Wonderland. 

This website has been created as the Fifth Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using a Full-Stack Toolkit, with the addition of E-commerce Applications such as Stripe. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, Heroku was then used to deploy the website.

## Site Goals:

The goals for this site are as follows:
* 

## UX:

### User stories:
To demonstrate the Agile approach that was used for this project, GitHub issues were used and a Kanban board was used to record all the user stories. 
The user stories were categorised using different labels, i.e MO - *Must have*, SO - *Should Have* and CO - *Could have*.
Each story was then moved from 'To Do' to 'In Progress' to  'Done' as the project progressed, with CO stories moved to a future feature board.
