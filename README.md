# Alices Wonderland: 

This website is designed for a fictional shop based in Wonderland. 

This website has been created as the Fifth Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using a Full-Stack Toolkit, with the addition of E-commerce Applications such as Stripe. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, Heroku was then used to deploy the website.

## Site Goals:

The goals for this site are as follows:
* 

## UX:

### User stories:
To demonstrate the Agile approach that was used for this project, GitHub issues were used and a Kanban board was used to record all the user stories. 
The user stories were categorised using different labels, i.e MO - *Must have*, SO - *Should Have* and CO - *Could have*.
Each story was then moved from 'To Do' to 'In Progress' to  'Done' as the project progressed, with CO stories moved to a future feature board.

## Development Planes:
To create a website that is comprehensive and informative for a user, as a developer you need to look at all aspects of the website and how someone who visits your website will use it. You have to consider all the user stories that have been outlined in the above sections.  

## Strategy
The strategy principal looks at user needs, as well product/service objectives. This website's target audience was broken down into three categories:
### Roles: 
* New User
* Existing User  

### Demographic:
* Aged between 25 to 60
* Working individuals with disposable income

### Psychographic:

#### Lifestyle:
* Collectors
* Planet enthusiast
* Exotic Animal enthusiast


#### The website needs to allow users to:  
* View products by price, category or rating
* Add products to a basket
* Edit product quantities and delete products straight from the basket
* Make secure payments for their products via credit card
* Create a user profile
* Contact the store with enquiries
* Sign up for a newsletter
* Leave reviews for products they bought
* Visit the stores social media accounts straight from the site 

#### The website needs to allow the store owner to:  
* Add, edit and delete products straight from the frontend site 
* Collect information from order forms
* Collect email address for the purpose of monthly marketing newsletter
* Approve of product reviews to unsure they are genuine customer reviews and not spam


## Scope:  

With the structure in place, it was then time to move onto the scope plane. This was all about developing website requirements based on the goals set out in the strategy plane. These requirements are broken down into two categories. 
### Content Requirements:
1. The user will be looking for:
      * 

### Functionality Requirements:
1. The user will be able to:
      *

## Testing:

## Bugs:
### DataError:
After importing Django Countries, I edited the Country field in the checkout model so that a dropdown menu appeared on the checkout form for the country. When I tried to migrate the changes I was getting a "DataError". If I ran a planned migration there were no error occuring but as soon as I removed plan the error would appear. 
* After a session with the CI tutors it was noted that I had a number of test orders in the database that were done under the old model (writting in the actual Country) and the changes were making it so the Country Field used the official ISO 3166-1 list of countries which has a default max lenght of 2. Once these test orders were deleted from the database the migration was able to be completed. 

&nbsp;

### Card Details:
Card details not appeating on checkout:
* When I set up the checkout eveything was working correctly except the card details box. This was not appearing at all. After rewatching the walk through video but everything seemed in order. After troubleshooting and chatting with some people in Slack and Stackoverflow it was suggested in the stripe_elements.js file to use the stripe public key in the "var stripe" instead of using an environment variable called stripePublicKey. Once I added the full key into the JS file that card details element appeared on the checkout page. 
<details>
<summary>Card Error:</summary>

<summary>Original JS file:</summary>

<summary>Updated JS file:</summary>

### Display Error:
If there were less than 4 images on a line they would display on top of eachother:
* After speaking with my mentor it was found that the basic layout of my products template was not structured correctly. After removing an extra row that was in the content block fixed this problem straight away.

</details> 

&nbsp;

### Edit Product Error:
When creating the add, edit and delete product functions for the site admin there was an Attribute Error occuring when I tried to test the 'Edit Product' functionality.
* After chatting with people on Slack it was suggested that I needed a for loop in the edit_products template to iterate through the each field of the form. I tried this but I was still getting the Attribute Error. 
* I then went to ask the CI tutors. It was their suggestion to try... 
<details>
<summary>Edit Product Error 1:</summary>

![Display Error](/documents/images/readme_images/edit_product.png)
</details> 

<details>
<summary>Edit Product Error 2:</summary>

![Display Error](/documents/images/readme_images/edit_product_2.png)

<details>
<summary>Edit Product Error 3:</summary>

![Display Error](/documents/images/readme_images/edit_product_3.png)
